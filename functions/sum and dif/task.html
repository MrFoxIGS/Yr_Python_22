<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions are blocks of code that are designed to do a specific job. Using fuctions make your code easier to write,
read, test and fix</p>
<p>To create a funtion you need to use the keword <code>def</code> (short for define)</p>
<p>After the keyword <code>def</code> you need a function name and you may
need parameters (inputs) for your function</p>
<p>The function defined on line 1 has a name sum and it has 2 parameters a and b<br>
The function defined on line 5 has a name greet and it doesn't have any parameters</p>
<p>The text in the triple quotes <code>"""</code> is called a docstring it is a brief description
of what the function does</p>
<p>The main body of the function is indented just like a loop
or a conditional</p>
<p>Some functions have a return value, this is the output of the function</p>
<p>Using a funtion is called calling the function. To call a function you just type the function name and any
    parameters. Lines 17 and 18 call the functions greet2 and sum. Try changing the parameters for both of them.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Fix the function dif, so that it returns the difference of a and b</p>
